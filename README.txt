This repo is forked from medcl, which is part of the Data Guru course here:
http://www.dataguru.cn/mycourse.php?lessonid=1958

There is a plugin (Head) repo also forked here:
https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head 

Head is the plugin that shows a Web GUI for the ElasticSearch interface.

To install Head, nodejs is to be installed, instruction can refer to here:
https://tecadmin.net/install-latest-nodejs-and-npm-on-centos/ 

So, I would suggest the installation sequence is:
1. ElasticSearch-RTF
2. NodeJS
3. Plugin elasticsearch-head
